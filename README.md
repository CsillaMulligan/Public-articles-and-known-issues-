# Public-articles-and-known-issues-
This repository contains samples of my public facing documentation I created during my time at Salesforce.  
## Table of contents
Two files with example links to my previous work. I created the original version of these documents. As all customer-facing documentation is regularly updated at Salesforce, therefore some of these articles were updated by my colleagues, some by me to keep them up to date with the latest Salesforce release.
